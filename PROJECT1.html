<h3><strong>What is <mark>intensity</mark>? How to be always intense?</strong></h3>
Life is intensity. Do you see the life within you does not slacken even for a moment?
 What slackens is your mind and your emotion - sometimes on, sometimes off. Watch the breath,
 does it ever slacken? If it slackens, it means death, isn't it? When I go on telling you in 
 so many ways to be intense, I am just talking about you becoming like life. Right now, you
 have given too much significance to the thought and emotion that happens within you, not the 
 life that is happening within you.
 <br>
 <strong>
So intensity means just going by the way of life. If you just exist here as life, pure life,
it will naturally go to its ultimate nature. You are creating a huge hurdle in the process of
life reaching its natural goal by becoming a thought, emotion, ideas, opinions, prejudices, 
anger, hatred and so many other things. If you just remain a piece of life, you will very
naturally reach your ultimate nature.</strong>
 <br>
It is not something that you have to strive for or struggle for. This is the reason I have
always been saying - <mark>"just maintain your intensity, the rest will happen."</mark>You do not have to
look for the way to heaven. Just maintain your intensity. There is nobody who can either take
this life to its ultimate nature or stop it. We can delay it or we can just allow it to go 
very quickly without any obstructions. This is all we can do.
 
Any spiritual process is about allowing it to happen as quickly as possible. You do not have
to call for gods to come and help you, you just have to become life and nothing but life. 
If you can just exist here as life is, you will naturally be there.
